#   each line in this file is limited to 200 characters

# `menupos' could be anywhere; can appear more than once (only the
#   last one will be utilized)
#   optional (if missing, the mouse coordinates are used, but without
#     centering)
#
# `iconsize' could be anywhere, but the given iconsize will be applied
#   only to items after the iconsize declaration; can appear more than
#   once (=> one can have each menu item with different icon size :D)
#   optional
#
# the triplet `item' `cmd' `icon' is non-separable; the order and the
#   presence of each item is mandatory (none of them could be missing)
#
# keybindings are standard GTK (arrows, enter, space...) and h|o (left)
#   n|u (right) c|. (up) t|e (down) [on the dvorak keyboard layout it builds
#   sort of "arrow keys"-like layout for each of both hands] and qgG like
#   in less(1)
#
# right after successfuly running/opening the menu, the middle item is
#   selected

# x y (px) offset of the center (both horiz + vert) of the menu
